          Gaming has become a highly prevalent leisure activity in the UK,
          especially among young adults aged between 16-24 years. Current data
          reveals that around 70% of individuals in this age group engage in
          video games as a form of entertainment. The Covid-19 pandemic and the
          ensuing lockdown measures have caused a remarkable surge in the number
          of individuals who play video games, peaking at over 90%. Even after
          the pandemic, the percentage of people who continue to play video
          games remains significantly higher compared to pre-pandemic levels,
          signifying a maintained interest in this popular pastime.
