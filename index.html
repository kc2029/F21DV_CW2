          reveals that around 70% of individuals in this age group engage in
          video games as a form of entertainment. The Covid-19 pandemic and the
          ensuing lockdown measures have caused a remarkable surge in the number
          of individuals who play video games, peaking at over 90%. Even after
          the pandemic, the percentage of people who continue to play video
          games remains significantly higher compared to pre-pandemic levels,
          signifying a maintained interest in this popular pastime.

        <p id="p5Title">Revenue split of the UK gaming Industry</p>
        <p id="p5p1">
          The UK gaming industry has seen a steady increase in revenue over the
          past few years. A significant portion of this revenue can be
          attributed to the rising popularity of loot boxes and
          microtransactions in games. Loot boxes is a virtual lottery with a
          chance to get a random in-game items (often cosmetics) of various
          rarity. It has become a controversial topic in the gaming community
          due to their exploitative nature especially toward childing and young
          adult. Despite this, the revenue generated by these features continues
          to grow, with some estimates suggesting that loot boxes alone
          generated over £700 million in the UK on 2019.
        </p>

        <p id="p5p2">
          From the graph, it is evident that the usage of loot boxes in games
          has significantly increased over the past 8 years. Initially, loot
          boxes were present in less than 10% of games, but it has risen to 70%
          in just 8 years as game developers realising the lucrative potential
          of exploiting gamers' gambling tendencies. <br /><br />
          However, this trend has also raised concerns about the potential harm
          caused to individuals with gambling disorders, particularly since loot
          boxes have been compared to virtual gambling. And there is growing
          calls for the UK govement to place ban on Loot box.

        <p id="p6p1">
          A survey was conducted on approximately 1000 gamers to determine their
          annual spending on microtransactions, which include cosmetic items,
          DLCs, and loot boxes, in the games they play. Although most of these
          games are free to play, players often spend more money on
          microtransactions than they would on purchasing a premium game. This
          trend is one of the reasons why microtransactions have become
          increasingly prevalent in the gaming industry in recent year
          <br /><br />
          Loot boxes alone accounted for $15 billion in revenue across the video
          game industry in 2020, according to Juniper Research

          Over 1 in 10 young gamers get into debt by buying loot boxes according
          to RSPH
          <ul id="list1">
            <li>
              Almost one in six (15%) young gamers had taken money from their
              parents without their permission to buy loots boxes; <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>
              One in ten (11%) had used their parent's credit or debit card to
              fund their loot box purchases;<br /><br />

              One in ten (11%) had used their parent's credit or debit card to

            The top 5% of Loot box buyer account for 50% of total loot box
            revenue. <br /><br />
            A small percentage of players are spending a disproportionate amount
            of money on loot boxes, suggest that they may have a gambling
            addiction or are vulnerable to developing one
