Over 1 in 10 young gamers get into debt by buying loot boxes
Almost one in six (15%) young gamers had taken money from their parents without their permission to buy loots boxes;
One in ten (11%) had used their parents’ credit or debit card to fund their loot box purchases;
One in ten (9%) had borrowed money they couldn’t repay to spend on loot boxes;
Three young gamers’ loot box buying habits resulted in their families having to re-mortgage their homes to cover the costs.

On top of the purchase price of the game, which is on average £35, almost one in four (22%) respondents spent over £100 on loot boxes over the course of completing a game, suggesting young people are being set on a path to an expensive and potentially addictive habit this Christmas.
